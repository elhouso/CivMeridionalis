## Dereliction

- The Derelictor General cannot delegate dereliction duties. ([Law](/government/council-acts#council-act-6-2))
- Players who have been inactive the longest are first in line for dereliction. ([Law](/government/council-acts#council-act-6-2))
- Where a property is fully or partially owned, regulated, or overseen by a Homeowner Association, that Homeowner Association takes first responsibility for dereliction should the occupant(s) go inactive.
- Occupants and owners should not be informed if and when they're up for dereliction to avoid property hoarding.
- Stored property from derelicts, such as chested items, must be held in government storage until reclaimed by the owner.
- Building materials from derelicts may also be held in government storage until reclaimed by the owner, particularly if they are expensive or exotic.
