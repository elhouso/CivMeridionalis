# Yoahtl Crimes Act (October 2018)

::: warning
The Yoahtl Crimes Act was repealed by Council Act 24.3 because we could not find a copy, and as such no longer provides legal definitions; but it was created from collected court precedent and does still represent the understanding of common crimes at the time, much of which has remained unchanged - Feather 8/6/2022

## Summary

The Yoahtl Crimes Act intends to provide a clear reference of existing case precedent and guidelines for court rulings. It does not attempt to create any new precedent, but does attempt to rephrase some rulings to be applicable under the Second Charter, and does attempt to clarify some precedents that were not recorded in explicit terms.

## Caveats

1. The Act is subject to legal precedent established before the courts. The Act does not replace, overrule, or invalidate any prior or future rulings.
1. The Act does not prevent the creation of new precedent contradictory to the Act.
   - a. The Act must be revised as new precedent is created.
1. Suggested sentences are merely references to prior sentences.
   - a. The Judge is fully justified in issuing harsher or more lenient sentences at their own discretion.
   - b. The Act must be revised as more sentences are issued.

## Crimes

### Violence

- **Assault** - Repeatedly causing hit point or durability damage to another player.

- **Murder** - Killing another player, including indirectly via traps or other structures.

#### Justifications:

- Self-defense, if the defendant has reasonable expectation of dying.
- National defense, if the plaintiff is not a Yoahtlan and is either violent or performing grief.
- Explicit authorisation of the courts in civil cases.
- Explicit authorisation of the Alcuahtl or relevant Ololtic in cases of national security.
- Implicit authorisation during military drills.
- Buildings still under construction cannot be considered death traps.
- Killing, but not pearling, an invisible player is acceptable if the invisible player did not make their identity and intentions clear to the accused prior to the defendant encountering the invisible player.
- Memeing is not an excuse for violence if both parties are not in on the meme.

#### Ruling Guidelines:

- Indirect assault or murder through traps or similar is still assault or murder.
- Pearled players should be released.
- Military drills must be explicitly authorised by the Alcuahtl.
- Memeing is not a defense if the plaintiff was not in on the meme.
- The more capable and more prepared fighter has a greater responsibility to behave maturely.
- Durability damage should be repaired at the defendantâ€™s expense if the plaintiff did not resist.
- End time of approximately 5 days is reserved for extreme cases with clear guilt.
