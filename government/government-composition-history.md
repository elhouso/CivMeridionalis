# Governments Before the Charters

Yoahtl's history begins before the charters, three generations before any current players were members. The history can be read on the wiki [here](https://civwiki.miraheze.org/wiki/History_of_Yoahtl), and to some is considered partially myth or legend; but there are some things that we do know.

The Chieftain is Yoahtl's cultural leader, and has existed since our origin. The Chieftains before the charter system was created were:
- Eoahtl
- Wichita
- Quauhtli_Mia
- WackyAki (from ~7/23/2017)

The Alcuahtl is Yoahtl's head of government, and was split off from the Chieftain early on to better organize ourselves. The Alcuahtls before the charter system was created were:
- Eoahtl
- Wichita
- Quauhtli_Mia
- St_Liebowitz (sometime during 7/30/2016 - 10/1/2016)
- Klasikrok (sometime during 7/30/2016 - 10/1/2016)
- Quauhtli_Mia (sometime during 7/30/2016 - 10/1/2016, resigned ~6/15/2017)
- St_Liebowitz (since 6/15/2017, deputy Asakuun from before 6/24/2017)
