# Conventions, General Practices, and "Unwritten" Rules

[[toc]]

## Territory

- Yoahtl should notify its citizens about updates to its territory, and so do with some kind of visual aid (eg: with a map)

## Elections

- The new council takes office on the 12th of the month (american time).
- The voting and candidacy announcement periods are 5-7 days each, consecutively.
- The Alcuahtl counts and manages the votes. A Councillor or the Alcuahtl posts the candidacy announcement and voting threads.

## Potions

- It is legal to kill (but not pearl) someone who is invisible in the city.

## Exile

- If a citizen/resident is convicted of a successive series of crimes increasing in severity without any improvement in behavior, the Alchuatl exiles them.
- Anyone who repeatedly refuses to engage in the Yoahtlan justice system after reasonable opportunity is exiled by the Alcuahtl.

## Council

- The bare minimum expectation of Councillor in-game activity is 1 hour per day.
- Councillors are expected to set example behavior and represent Yoahtl to foreigners in a positive light.
- If a Councillor resigns or is removed from office and national activity isn't high enough to justify a replacement Councillor as per the charter's guidelines, the seat will remain empty.

## Ascension Protocol

- The Alcuahtl is expected to stand down if they feel they are approaching a mental breakdown.
- The Alcuahtl may bypass the ascension procedure and nominate a successor that is not the deputy (if this is widely challenged the charter's rules must take precedence).

## Alcuahtl and Deputy

- The Deputy is expected to make up for any deficiencies in the Alcuahtl with respect to personal qualities, management style, etc.
- A national vision is expected from the Alcuahtl/Deputy.
