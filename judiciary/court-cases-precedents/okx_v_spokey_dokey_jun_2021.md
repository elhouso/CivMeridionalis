# Okx v. spokey_dokey, Jun 2021
## Case
With GDAN presiding, on 15th June 2021, Okx charged spokey_dokey with Attempted Theft and Burglary. GDAN found spokey_dokey guilty of Theft, Attempted Theft, and Burglary and sentenced to reinforcement-restitution and a total of 21 days Exile Pearled.

## Proceedings
**Okx:**

> Hello, I would like to open a criminal prosecution against spokey_dokey for attempted theft of 90 CS of sugar cane and 10 CS melon, as well as damage to my farm

**SpaceVolcano:**

>The court will hear the case of Okx vs spokey_dokey on the charges of theft and property damage.

>GDAN will be presiding

**GDAN:**

>Thank you High Justice. The court will now come to order.

>Okx, As the prosecution, I call on you to make an opening statement.

**Okx:**

>Thank you.

>The individual known as spokey_dokey broke into my XP supplies storage, by breaking a diamond reinforced door and six diamond reinforced chests, over the course of approximately two hours. They had on their possession a golden axe with efficiency five and unbreaking three, the most efficient way of breaking into chests, as well as an efficiency five diamond pickaxe. They came prepared to break in, as one does not usually carry around a golden axe. I believe the defense would be obliged to tell the court how they gained possession of these specialised tools.

>After repeatedly hitting my snitches over multiple days, I went to the farm and saw what they were doing, and pearled them. Nearby, on my ice road below the farm, I broke stone reinforced chests containing all of the stolen goods, totalling 90 CS of sugar cane and 10 CS of melon, with a total value of 422 emerald blocks. They even had the audacity to ask the value of melon in global chat.

>This individual had only joined the server four days prior, but by visiting my farm and breaking in across multiple days, as snitch logs show, and using specialised tools to break into chests and reinforcing the chests with the stolen goods, they displayed an unusual level of knowledge of civ mechanics and persistence for such a new account. They were clearly not a newfriend, and as chat logs show, had previously played on Civ Universe. They knew exactly what they were doing. And they knew the consequences. This was an act of malice. Not "looking for a thrill".

>He says he would be a "good boy" from now on, yet that is exactly what he said when he first joined the server. He will most likely reoffend if given a light sentence.

**GDAN:**

>spokey_dokey, Please submit a plea in regard to the above, either guilty or not-guilty.

**spokey_dokey:**

>specifically to the fact that I did indeed break the chests, I plead "guilty"

>I'll respond to allegations beyond that in order

>I believe the defense would be obliged to tell the court how they gained possession of these specialised tools.

>\- I was given by a friend who played and sinced stopped a carepackage of emeralds and some diamonds. I bought the pick from Icena and made the axe myself

>They even had the audacity to ask the value of melon in global chat

>\-I was curious

>they displayed an unusual level of knowledge of civ mechanics and persistence for such a new account. They were clearly not a newfriend,

>\-I am 100% new to this server, but never have claimed to be a newfriend. I've had chats with convoy swiftfizz and others in main chat. My old name was HaKr_

>This was an act of malice. Not "looking for a thrill" -Honestly, it was. I have no connections yet on this server, it was, so i thought, the perfect time. Also with nobody dming me to ask what I was up to I honestly considered this place abandoned as i was there for 3 days in various times.

>He says he would be a "good boy" from now on, -And I will be. I was known as generally a nice person on CivU and on Dev 3. I skipped classics but am now looking for a server to play. past this I will be a more honest civ player

>Final note: you say what I tried to take had a value of 422 emerald blocks. Why do you keep it in such an unreinforced area? This will definitely be a lesson to me, but this should be one to you. if anyone even remotely competent was there instead of me you actually would have lost things. You had a Diamond Reinforced door on a IRO block, and each chest was full of valubles.

**Okx:**

>Objection, the defense was only asked for a plea

**spokey_dokey:**

>Your constitutions say we get opening statements one after another yes

**GDAN:**

>Okx, Can you please clarify what it is you specifically want the defense charged with. I will then ask them for a plea in relation to that. I can understand that it wasn't 100% clear to the defense which parts they had to plea to.

**Okx:**

>Attempted theft and burglary

**spokey_dokey:**

>Guilty

**Okx:**

>Actually could I change that to three charges of theft, attempted theft, and burglary

**GDAN:**

>How do you plea to all three ?

**spokey_dokey:**

>Theft - not guilty

>Attempted theft - guilty

>Burglary - not guilty

**GDAN:**

>Thank you

>Okx, You may now present any evidence or witnesses that support your claims

**spokey_dokey:**

**GDAN:**

>spokey_dokey, Do you have any additional facts to submit that may be relevant to the outcome of the case ?

**spokey_dokey:**

>No, not really

**GDAN:**

>Okx, Please make your closing statement

**Okx:**

>spokey_dokey broke in through the door of my bunker and broke all the chests inside. They had already transported most of the goods underground and about thirty blocks away from all the farm infrastructure into their own reinforced chests before being caught, and they lied when asked what they were doing ("exploring"). This individual played on CivUniverse and when they joined CivClassics showed no interest in following our customs, and will likely go straight back to raiding when released. The excuse of the area being abandoned is ridiculous, as individual was already informed that it was Yoahtlan territory in global chat, and then said "im annexing it back ... to Dirt". There was no purpose to this other than the enjoyment of raiding.

**GDAN:**

>If that is all, spokey_dokey please give a closing statement

**spokey_dokey:**

>Ladies and Gentlemen (and everyone in between) of the Court. The story the prosecution tells is one of selfishness... one of malice. I am essentially painted as an agent of Chaos who will reek not but destruction upon classics it I am to be free.

>In the interest of full honestly, there is some truth to that. It was a selfish crime. But not one of malice but of greed and ignorance. I was under the impression that more areas in classics were inactive than anything and sought to profit off that and skip some of the grind.: and a gold block on the ground that leads straight to diamond reinforced chests is hard to resist with that mindset. I am truly sorry and will tackle this server with a more legitimate mindset henceforth.

>I have been forthcoming and compliant with all court proceedings. I request also that the court recognize and take into account that I was not a shitter on previous servers. I am currently a chat mod for the currently “on hiatus” Civ U

>As for final thoughts I would like to close this off with two things:

>a reminder to take all quotes of me claiming to be a new friend, or annexation of claimed territories etc. with a grain of salt. In context of things these were obviously cheeky comments and were shown here specifically to push a specific narrative.

>Request for the benefit of the doubt from the court. A ridiculously long sentence will just keep me off the server forever, and I do plan to be a productive member of society.

**GDAN:**

>spokey_dokey, I find you guilty of theft, attempted theft and burglary. In line with precedent you would have to pay back anything you had stolen however I believe it is already recovered. All damages caused by you breaking in and breaking chests need to be repaid for a total of 1 iron and 12 diamonds.

>As for your sentence I believe 3 weeks exile pearled would suffice due to this being a first offence. If you offend again in the future expect your punishment to be more severe. Your sentence will end on the 4th of July 2021.
