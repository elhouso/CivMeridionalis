**Feathercrown**:

>Judges, please explain your side of the story. Proof may be used.

**Judges**:

>Alright, sorry for taking so long I've been trying to get in contact with Modshot who is my main witness and hes been offline. Anyway, the main point I would like to make is that that situation was already settled with Modshot and was caused by Bg removing me from the discord randomly (which Modshot understood and added me back). Bg doesn't want me pearled because of that though. He wants me pearled because of the post on the sub of him denying me to be in the discord and him acting very rude to me which hurt his PR. You can see this clearly in these screenshots https://imgur.com/a/BV6hKWP.

>I would further like to state that Bg didn't even remember that I was pearled until I asked him to unpearl me. https://gyazo.com/d362a5776acfa971beb34bd52a0e9b1c

>Anyway thats all my proof for this situation however I would also like to state that Bg has been trying to deny me my rights of a trial all throughout this situation which Feather himself has seen. I can provide proof of that as well if needed.

**Feathercrown**:

>Ok so after much deliberation with Judges, Bgbba, and Modshot, I have chosen to sentence Judges to 5 months of pearl time for treason and association with enemies. However, he has already served more than said pearl time, and shall be released immediately. Given that his pearl was mishandled and he does seem genuinely interested in Yoahtl's future, if Judges wishes, he may reenter Yoahtl on a probationary period of 1.5 months within which any disruption of the community or major crime will result in his exile from Yoahtl.
