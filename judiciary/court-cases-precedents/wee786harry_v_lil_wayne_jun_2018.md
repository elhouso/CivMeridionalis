**Oddish**:

>right now the evidence thats presented shows that both sides have aggravated each other to some extent, the witnesses and known behaviour of weeharry raises some concerns as to the validity of this fight given that it was shown after both sides are potted and with pvp gear and have meet before. Although the video does show that the fight was started by thoths. However given the fact it is known harry is an agitator and that both sides have armour and pots prior to the fight starting I see no major reason of unjust fighting here. I do see two sides bickering and fighting against each other so I will like to make a decision to solve this.

>lil_wayne, you are asked by the courts to not interact with weeharry and to leave him well alone, I do not want another fight and will consider this as a warning, Also to return any armour, pots or wepons taken from harry or the yoahtl pot bunker on the 16th of june

>Wee786Harry, The court asks that you cease agitation to other residence and allies of Yoahtl to help prevent this from happening again. also this will be considered as a formal warning to you. any further cases will be taken into consideration for the government to make a decision as to have you remain as a resident.
