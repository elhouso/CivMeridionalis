**Shygdsamkd**:

> you win

**solitaire1**:

> `@Aki`  Please present your opening statement

**Aki**:

> Hello all.
> 
> Basically, a few weeks ago Shygd was in my house, on the very top floor without permission. I generally didnt care until he tried opening my chests and said he would be enjoying my picks "soon enough". I killed him under the suspicion that he had a pick of mine after he refused to tell me if he stole from the chest. After doing so he messaged "Enjoy getting your house griefed" A few days later I find that the mapart, a nautulus shell and 16 pearls were stolen, and Shygd on snitches entering my house and then leaving around 20 minutes later. 
> 
> THe mailbox thing was because my mailbox has been stuffed with random blocks and the tools in the newfriend tool chest to the poiint where the hopper cant take anything more, rendering it useless. After Shy was pearled the mailbox has been untouched and has worked perfectly, and in combo with the messages about leaving me "presents" in the marketplace chat, led me to believe he was the one stuffing the mailbox
> that ends my statement

**Shygdsamkd**:

> <a:duckstriding:857154271598084096>

**solitaire1**:

> `@Shygdsamkd`  How do you plea ?

> Right here he admits to stealing pearls
> So all of this involved illegally trespassing into my home, breaking my things and opening chests clearly not marked for anyone to take.
> As for harassment, Shy has spent the last few days constantly pinging me on discord, sending harassing messages and insults long after I told him to stop
> He pinged me in this channel 3 times in one day,

**Shygdsamkd**:

> I was joking

**solitaire1**:

> `@Saint Neo`  Please give a statement as a witness

**Aki**:

> As the court can see, he spammed my name, constantly pings me, and requests I take my bipolar pills (probably not out of concern for my mental health tbh). He also just straight up admits that he did the crime in global chat and in this very trial.

I have no idea what mapart he is talking about and i never touches his pickaxes. I was also not the ont to fill his mailbox with shit from public chests. That was Miller and he has already admitted to doing it. The evidence that he provided was circumstantial and the witness can mot be trusted due to his collection of rare diseases. Finally, continually throughout the trial he has been harassing me in discord, in global chat and in DMs. He publically admitted to doing all these things in global chat and in this discord. Longtime friend of the nation and the chief military officer General Neotide saw shy stuff my mailbox.

**solitaire1**:

> I find shy guilty of both raiding and harassment. The evidence submitted by Aki shows that Shy admitted to this at the time and Shy has provided no substantial evidence to show that he did not commit the crimes.
> 
> For the crime of raiding I sentence Shy to 2 weeks pearled due to the value of what he took, and for harassment he shall receive a single week. His sentence shall start from today due to his attempts to stall this trial so the time he spent on trial does not count.
> 
> He shall be released on the 31st July.
> 
> For the raiding, as is precedent, he must also repay the value of what was stolen. After consulting with the prosecution this amounts to 64 diamonds. Currently shy is prison pearled due to reports of harassment from other friends on the server and he shall remain prison pearled for the duration of his trial, therefore he'll have 2 weeks upon release to pay his reps. If he does not he shall be exile pearled until he does.
> 
> I would like to make a note that this is the first official time that Shy has been put on trial for harassment but that he has displayed a constant bad attitude and continually harasses others in the discord and in-game. A little trolling is fine, but this level of trolling crosses the line of harassment, he should dial it back and fix his attitude otherwise the next time he is tried for harassment it will likely result in expulsion from the nation and discord.
