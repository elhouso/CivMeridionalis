# Yoahtl v. Fran, Nov 2017

**Judge**: bgbba

**Date**: 5th November 2017

## Charges

Construction of a deathtrap.

## Plea

Not guilty by reason of not being responsible for the design of the deathtrap and the creation of the deathtrap was an attempt to stop further action by the designer in question.

## Proceedings

Arbitration in-game and via voice chat solved the issue.

## Outcome

For one count of constructing an unapproved deathtrap I find you not guilty. This is essentially an issue of contract law. Machinemaker was contracted by Fran to fix the water drop to the storage room. Machine was told to stop doing it and he continued. In an attempt to stop the damage, Fran caused the creation of a deathtrap. -bgbba
