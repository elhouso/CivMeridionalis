**meat312**:

>Wingzero54 Opening statements

**Wingzero54**:

>Wee Harry was making threatening statements to Orin and I felt it necessary to strike him

**meat312**:

>Evidence of this? or perhaps Orinnari whitnessed?

**Wingzero54**:

>I also felt Harry deserved a taste of his own medicine, considering he has been running around smacking people

**Wee786Harry**:

>I did not make one threatining statement to orin - I Would like to see proof (as there is none i would also see a punisment for someone lying) - My punishment was already served so why does he consder giving another one personally out? Taking justice into his hands is not right.

>Orinna stood there however i did not say nor do nothing to him

>As i passed him

**meat312**:

>Wingzero54 Do you have any evidence?

**Wingzero54**:

>As the threats were made in voice chat I have no record of them

**meat312**:

>Were there any whitnesses

**Wingzero54**:

>I don't wish to delay this further, Orin made a brief statement earlier:

>So as you can see, I was standing there. Harry was being weird and getting all up in my personal space, it was kinda weird and I was wondering whether he was hitting on me. Then he got all hot and bothered, as you can see, then Wingzero54 started blaming me for it. I mean, I know I'm attractive and all... but really?

**Orinnari**:

>Forgive me, I completely forgot. Here is the raw footage ( https://www.dropbox.com/s/rp8u2hpwlpa8d7x/2018-06-06%2020-31-43.mp4?dl=0 ) but there's only the ingame audio and so is missing the context of the voice call

**Wee786Harry**:

>Because there was no in game context of the voice call relating to what happened...What happened was wingzero damage my armor and hit me for no reason... Thats the FACT

**meat312**:

>After reviewing the evidence I find that Wee786Harry probably did make verbal threats of some nature to Orinnari.

>However without the nature of these threats or complete context the court must side on the precautionary side, in that his freedom to speak shal be protected. However I caution Wee786Harry that should he attempt to commit physical abuse of a fellow citizen again, he will be punished.

>Orinnari, Although he may have threatened you, there are options available to you which do not require the force of govt. /ignore or mute him and if he continues, this court will see that as harassment.

>Wingzero54, the authorization of force is held within the power of govt. As deputy Alcuahtl I am sure I do not need to inform you of the responsibilities that position confers. However, your actions were not thought through, and careless. Less violent means of action were available to you.

>For beating a resident without just cause, I fine you 1 iron in reparations to the plaintiff.

>Good day.
