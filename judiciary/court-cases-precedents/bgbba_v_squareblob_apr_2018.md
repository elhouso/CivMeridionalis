# bgbba v. Squareblob, Apr 2018
## Case
With Wingzero54 presiding, on 3rd April 2018, bgbba sued for clarification for derelicting Squareblob's property. Wingzero54 established that citizenship or residency status is not relevant to the question of dereliction.

## Proceedings
**bgbba**:

>I am bringing a government inquiry against the residency status and plot ownership of Squareblob, as well as a clarification of residency status on the whole.

>According to the Yoahtlan constitution, citizenship can be removed on the basis of inactivity, however no such provision applies to residency.

>Squareblob is the leader of Iria and no longer maintains his plot in the undercity of NYC. However, he remains active. The rules for dereliction do not clarify whether or not an active player who doesn't spend most of their time within NYC can be evicted. As they are written, it leads me to believe that Squareblob is immune to dereliction. I am suing to determine the correct procedure for dereliction, as the dereliction officer. The charter in addition does not establish a clear difference between the jurisdiction of the alcuahtl over citizenship vs residency status, as meat312 brought up earlier in a petition to see the citizenship and residency rules revised. This needs to be addressed.

>As the accused, Squareblob has the right to choose a judge

**Squareblob**:

>Wingzero

**Wingzero54**:

>I am present and willing

**bgbba**:

>Squareblob is no longer active in NYC. He himself has admitted this.

>It is my duty as dereliction officer to remove inactive things from the city

>However, the current law doesn't specify what inactive means in regards to people who are only residents

>I argue that activity relates specifically to interactions with the Yoahtlan community ingame

**Wingzero54**:

>Thank you BG. Squareblob can you provide a statement regarding your activity within Yoahtl and how your residency is affected by being leader of Iria and spending the majority of your time there?

**Squareblob**:

>Bg is correct in that I have been inactive for a number of weeks though I wouldn't necessarily attribute it to doing in game things.

>Do I need an E-Lawyer? If only for entertainment purposes

**Wingzero54**:

>I am going to admit Square's activity report for the trial records

>>Activity Report for Squareblob

**bgbba**:

>43 days ago

**meat312**:

>->his alt has been in NYC tho (sorry for interupt)

**bgbba**:

>There you go

**Wingzero54**:

>Squareblob How do you respond to BG's request to derelict you? Do you object to be derelicted? De facto policy is to wait for a 2 week inactivity before derelicting citizens, but you are not a citizen of Yoahtl.

**Squareblob**:

>It goes without saying I would rather not be derelicted

**bgbba**:

>My issue here is that this essentially means that residents are unable to be derelicted then

**Wingzero54**:

>Reflecting on Yoahtl's legal documentation, and court precedence, I turn to the Second Council's 6.2 decision which states " The Alcuahtl assigns dereliction duty to an individual councillor. This duty cannot be delegated. The longest-inactive players are the first available for eviction and dereliction. The Derelictor and Alcuahtl have discretion over the need to derelict, but but cannot abuse the power. The other two councillors may force the Alcuahtl to reconsider their choice of derelictor, but may not force a resignation without proof of wrongdoing."

>This law is the basis for all Yoahtlan derelictions. There is no statement in the law regarding citizenship, residency, or status otherwise. Therefore, there can be no restrictions on the dereliction officer regarding ability to derelict based on residency or citizenship status, because no guidelines are set forth in the legal code for dereliction.

>Dereliction is a seizure of land on the basis of inactivity, in order to repurpose the land. Dereliction has no basis in citizenship or residency or status otherwise. This is why people who are granted land to build on, such as for embassy's or foreign owned shops, are allowed to be derelicted (as has been done in the past). It is because dereliction is based on land usage, not residency laws. Therefore, this court finds no restrictions on bgbba's ability to derelict Squareblob based on his status of a resident instead of citizen.
