**X_an**:

**VilyanZ**:

**Huskydog9988**:

> please avoid talking in here

> is you wanna comment or whatever there are other channels

**Mokotowskie**:

> `@Arconis` Please submit your opening statement.

**Arconis**:

> I found that `@Buglesz` stole a whole armor set from my shops display set with proof from a government snitch, screenshot provided by `@Saint Neo`

>

> Here is proof he broke into my shop through the wall and stole the armor via snitch logs and he also attempted to break into my netherite sword chest but have no snitch proof

> `@Mokotowskie`

**Mokotowskie**:

> `@Arconis` Ok, thank you for making your opening statement and I will look into any evidence and arguments provided by both sides later in the process. So just hang on tight

> `@Buglesz` Please make your opening statement.

> Since it has been 24 hrs and `@Buglesz` has not made a response or any opening statement on their part, the court will automatically move on with Buglesz in absentia (with the presumption of pleading innocent to the accusation provided in the open statement from `@Arconis` as well as similar sentiments felt by `@ACCoker` and `@Pantherr` )

**Buglesz**:

> Hello

**Mokotowskie**:

> Will you defend your case?

**Buglesz**:

> Hm, if I plead guilty do I get a reduced Crime Sentence

**Mokotowskie**:

> If you plead guilty, it may be possible to have an effect on reducing your sentence. However, the opportunity to be given a lesser penalty in time will have to depend largely on your cooperation and the satisfaction of the grieved members that bought these charges against you. In this specific case, you may have to repatriate the items you were accused of stealing and compensate any other damages that they may have been dealt with. After these conditions have been met, a reduced sentence may be given, otherwise, if the contingent terms for a lesser sentence are not met then a default harsher sentence still applies.

> `@Buglesz` You still need to plead either not guilty or guilty.

> Ok, too much time has passed and `@Buglesz` has not responded. We will continue on with the trial with buglesz held in absentia. `@Arconis` `@ACCoker` `@Pantherr`, please bring forth any evidence and witnesses to the trial.

**Arconis**:

> Only evidence I have is in the original opening statement of him breaking the blocks that lead to an armor stand of which the armor was stolen

> `@Mokotowskie`

**Mokotowskie**:

> Ok thank you

> `@Pantherr` `@ACCoker` Do any of you have anything to add or call upon any witnesses?

**ACCoker**:

> buglesz was discovered on snitches frequently at the time of the crime. also, 2 minutes after pantherr logged in and discovered the theft, buglesz logged out, which we found suspicious. upon pursuit of the suspect, we discovered a specific area outside the city walls that buglesz visited numerous times during the time of the theft (confirmed by snitches). he also tried to evade multiple yoahtl members attempting to apprehend him the following day in the same area. the stolen items have not been recovered, but this is our evidence. if it please the court, we would also like to call a witness to the stand, `@ArkenX` the lead investigator on this case.

**Mokotowskie**:

> Ok, `@ArkenX` You may come forth and speak as a witness

**ArkenX**:

> `@Mokotowskie` My investigation confirmed that Buglesz was the only person in the vicinity of the theft when it happened. ACCoker logged out in the room where the main break occurred and confirmed that their chests were intact at logout. Further, Buglesz is on snitches having broken a Lodestone in the center of the city, along with several other blocks. This lodestone was used to directly teleport into the base of `@ACCoker` and `@Pantherr`, as it was placed on the surface of the hill above the base in line with the existing lodestone. I believe Buglesz used information from ACCokers' videos to determine exactly where to attack from.

**ACCoker**:

> i would also like to add that we had previously given Buglesz a tour of the base as well, so he had already seen the inside layout with his own eyes days before the theft

**Mokotowskie**:

> Thank you `@ACCoker` and `@ArkenX` for your testimonies.

> Since Buglesz is not present for this trial, they are not able to call upon witnesses and provide their own evidence and testimony. Nor is a cross-examination possible.

> `@High Justice` How will the court proceed from here if the defendant is absent at this point once the prosecutors have given their evidence, testimony, and witnesses? Should the trial automatically proceed or should a pause be given in case `@Buglesz` becomes present?

**Huskydog9988**:

> From a legal perspective I think you just go on. Id like to not make this precedent, but due to charles seemingly sporadic behavior I'd prefer you give them time, but I'm not gonna hold you too it. If you want to move on I think its well within your power. `@Mokotowskie`

**Mokotowskie**:

> Very well, given that trials held against defendants who are absent are uncommon, I will give `@Buglesz` until April 18, 2023 12:00 pm CST <t:1681837200:R> to make a response before the trial moves on to the closing statements and sentencing.

> In the meantime, `@Arconis` `@ACCoker` `@Pantherr` you are free to bring up any additional evidence that could help your case.

**Abm13**:

> i have killer evidence

> i like arconis better

**Huskydog9988**:

> `@Abm13` please avoid joking in this channel.

**Abm13**:

> sorry husky

**Huskydog9988**:

> All good

**Mokotowskie**:

> `@Buglesz` has not shown up and the time for response is up.

> `@Arconis` `@ACCoker` `@Pantherr` You may give your closing statements.

**Arconis**:

> Well as it seems we won't be receiving reps or our items back from the defendant there's not much to say.`@Mokotowskie`

**Mokotowskie**:

> Very well, I shall give a sentencing. Thank you `@Arconis` for your statement.

> `@Arconis` `@Pantherr` `@ACCoker` I conclude this trial. I apologize for any delays.
>
> Buglesz:

> I sentence Buglesz `@Buglesz` to 3 weeks prison pearl time.
