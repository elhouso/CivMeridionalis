**ArowShot**:

> Okay 1machinemaker1 what's your side of the story

**1machinemaker1**:

> okay, my version: 14 takes six stacks of iron and a stack of obby from a chest at the obby grinder, i say stuff about it, this is fine

**14uu**:

> 5 stacks  
> not 6

**1machinemaker1**:

> five, sure  
> i don't recall exactly  
> but yeah we established five after that  
> anyway, we meet, he shows up with full dia + dia sword, starts attacking me  
> i attack back and kill him  
> he had a pearl on him, and said he was trying to pearl me later, for lols  
> at this point i try to pearl him for committing a crime and hold him, but free his pearl because right clicking  
> i then keep his stuff for the same reason, him comitting a crime  
> he then kills me while i afk  
> this is really f**\***g stupid  
> 14 please stop s\*\*tstirring  
> i didn't even want to take this to trial, just wanted to negotiate, and holding things is a common practice when one has committed a crime

**ArowShot**:

> Okay well I have enough to decide, here's the sentence: Both of you give each other stuff back, 14 goes first, then 14 you'll go on probation for 3 days or until machine says you can be free

**1machinemaker1**:

> sounds great  
> what's probation

**ArowShot**:

> pearled and summoned  
> and no attacking people  
> probation will also be put on hold in the event of conflict where it is necessary for 14 to fight
