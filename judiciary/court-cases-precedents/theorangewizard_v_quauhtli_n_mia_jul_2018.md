>Quauhtli'n'Mia since the evidence for you killing orange is listed above i wont ask you to confirm or deny that you killed orange, but can you tell me why you did it

**Quauhtli'n'Mia**:

>He came to NYC asking to live here, I told him that only people who havnt already lived in Yoahtl can live in or around Axochitlan; the only exception being dr_oracle.

>I was somewhat receptive

>however he made his mt doom, I told him noone was able to live in mt doom

>Despite being told he could not live there he'd say in VC that it was his; around the third time I was sure he was memeing around

>regardless I know memeing is usually half-rooted in truth

>I wouldnt stand for it

>So I told him to leave

>did it for like 30 minutes

>I kept wacking him with a sword telling him to leave

>even once trapped him in a hole

**Oddish**:

>if your telling him to leave why would you trap him preventing him to leave

**Quauhtli'n'Mia**:

>This is him trying to get out

>Well by now I was pretty sure he was memeing

>So I thought "hey I can have some fun too"

>didnt take him long to get out

>the bastions in mt doom werent really working so he just built his way out

>albiet he had to break some of the slabs to do it

>as youcan see

>however when he got out

>he still wouldnt leave

>by now I had to get serious

>I wacked him off the island, (knockback sword)

**Oddish**:

>and he died

**Quauhtli'n'Mia**:

>nah

>he landed in the ocean

>twice

>i did this tweice

>and he swam back

>I really didnt want to kill him

>but I would if he kept memeing too close to the sun

>so I warned him one final time

>"I will legitmately kill you, if you do not leave"

>he kept coming

>so I killed him

>So post-mortem; he asked about his stuff

>I told him its mine, this was me memeing back

>Im kind of suprisedhe couldnt tell

>:>

>so I let up after a bit

>and told him i'd be halfway through the rails

>( or what WOULD be rails)

>to give him his stuff

>he told me that because I killed him i need to come all the way to axo to give him his stuff

>naturally, I thought this was a bit wierd and wierd

>then orange left

>he had to go to bed

>and after that I had to got to bed too

>it was like almost 5 am

**TheOrangeWizard**:

>quau's account is basically correct, he was aware i was meming but still harassed me for ~30 minutes before killing me and refusing to return my things

**Oddish**:

>ALRIGHT ALRIGHT

>now i know for a fact he said that he would return your stuff after memeing around about keeping it

>now this is a simple case really. weve had cases about stolen goods and death piles before, qua i want you to return oranges stuff to a reasonable point where both parties can get to , meeting in a city half way would be best, if either party is happy to travel all the way to retrieve or deposit goods then thats a better scenario. since both of you were meming around and at some point went too far with it i wont be awarding any reparations for this case UNLESS the goods are not returned and this case is brought up again. Orange please in future learn when a meme has taken its course and gotten to far, Qua. Murder isnt a meme. point blank. if orange didnt have his home set we would have him random spawn somewhere. please in future refrain from killing an individual.
