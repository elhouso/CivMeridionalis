**awesome_daniel**:

> Thank you. Court is now in session.
> I call upon the prosecution, represented by `@nukinmouse`, to deliver an opening statement.

**nukinmouse**:

> As said in *Aki vs Sventhar October 2019*, every Yoahtlan has right to be free from harassment. Tory has constantly harassed me over a dereliction that was retroactively approved by the Government of Yoahtl (before I was Councillor). While I was counciller, I had derelicted an inactive build she has been attacking my character over and over in vc and dms with other players. Tory has been telling me to kill myself after an arguement in vc and when cleaning up plant matter from the trees that she grew over the trench. And she has done other various actions that caused other players to ask her to stop, but some she still does to this day. As a result I wish to charge her with Minor Harassment as laid out in *Nation of Yoahtl Appellate Court* Document

**awesome_daniel**:

> Thank you. I will now turn to the defense, represented by `@torynado`, to issue a plea in response to the charges brought forward by the prosecution, either in guilt or non-guilt.

**torynado**:

> Thank you your honor.  
> 
> May I get the links to the aforementioned documents before entering a plea?

**Huskydog9988**:

**torynado**:

> Thank you 👍
> I plead guilty to minor harassment and would like to sue Nukin for major harassment.
> Thank you your honor

**awesome_daniel**:

> The court recognizes the defendant's guilty plea to the charge of minor harassment and the counterclaim for major harassment against the prosecution. Please proceed with your opening statement.

**torynado**:

> Thank you your honor.
> Might you clarify to whom you refer to as "the defense" now that I plead guilty?
> Idk if this is a counter suit or different trial
> Thanks again!❤️
> Counter claim is most efficient
> What if I don't counter sue.  And sue on a later date?  Or not at all?
> Hmmm

**awesome_daniel**:

> My apologies, the former prosecution shall henceforth be referred to as the counter-defendant and the former defense shall now be referred to as the counter-claimant.
> To clarify further, the proceedings will transition from the defense to the counterclaim. We have now moved from the defense's presentation to the counterclaimant's case. The guilty plea entered by the defendant to the charge of minor harassment will be addressed at the conclusion of this trial. We will first proceed with the counterclaim proceedings, and the matter of the guilty plea will be addressed during the final phase of these proceedings.

**torynado**:

> Got it.  Thanks!  ❤️ opening statement soon
> Thank you for your patience, your honor.

> Space Volcano says it best with a TL;DR in court document 2.
> *Don't be a dick guys. Be reasonable, be courteous, be respectful. Our discord is a privilege. Keep it fun, and memes are more fun if everyone is in on them.*
> 
> With that I'm mind, I may provide evidence etc. of counsillor nukins intentional harassment of me in the spirit of the October, 2019 Appellate Court Ruling
> 
> *3. Major Harassment
> A severe act of Harassment by an acting individual done in a cruel and
> intentional manner done; with the intent of forcing someone to leave the

**awesome_daniel**:

> Thank you for your opening statement. I now invite the counter-defendant, `@nukinmouse`, to present their response to the counterclaim.

**nukinmouse**:

> i dont really know how to respond to this as there isnt really anything to respond to right now
> i guess, i havent harrased tory and this case doesnt have ground to stand on

**awesome_daniel**:

> Thank you for providing your position. Your disagreement with the counterclaim is sufficient as a response.
> I would now like to call upon `@torynado` to present any evidence or witnesses in support of the counterclaim.

**torynado**:

> Thank you your honor.  
> 
> I'd like to submit evidence of Counsillor Nukinmouse intentionally killing me twice with malicious intent.  At Kobylinski and at Altepetl.

**nukinmouse**:

> `@awesome_daniel` im sorry to interupt but is there some legal way we can speed this along

**awesome_daniel**:

> After the presentation of any evidence, and if both parties are in agreement, we can consider skipping any cross-examination and/or closing statements and proceed directly to the ruling.
> `@torynado` please finish submitting evidence in support of the counterclaim.

**torynado**:

> Thank you your honor.  I'm nearly finished assembling the supporting evidence.

**awesome_daniel**:

> `@torynado` please try and submit your evidence by <t:1696642560:t> (48 hours after initial notice).

**torynado**:

> Thank you for your patience.
> Point 1 - No one should tell people to kill themselves.
> We shouldn't tell people to kill themselves in any context of any form of semantics.  
> i told Counsillor Nukinmouse to
>    "Die in hell"
>    "Jump off a cliff"
>    "i hate you"
> 
> in my opinion, Counsillor Nukinmouse was more angry that I said that "i hate" him whilst i'm feeling real emotional distress. https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/348687557455904778/1159961851103293550/evidence_nukinmouse_2.png?ex=6532eda8&is=652078a8&hm=d9bc9a53342e8f3562d52b85fa05af87c2d8c19f2248d762a077e82929ab2e16&=&width=304&height=676
> 
> Part of this hatred is that Nukinmouse constantly replies to actual conversations in vc with "Why don't you kill yourself" to me and others.  I hate it when he does it every time. https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/348687557455904778/1159961776893480980/evidence_6_x1025.jpg?ex=6532ed96&is=65207896&hm=cead382bcb47e8ca55eccd5139e875284c898cf37cc1e1930c4b2e8cc75a0e26&=&width=615&height=676
> 
> Saying, "Why don't you kill yourself?" is part of Counsillor Nukinmouse's regular speech pattern.  It's not nice.
> now uploading some private conversations for "context"
> Point 2 - Counsillor Nukinmouse is a Destroyer whilst I am a Preservationist
> 
> No other yoahtlan, on this iteration being CivMC, has initiated and participated in the demolition of Yoahtlan builds more than Nukinmouse.  
> 
> Nukinmouse has torn down far more Yoahtlan homes builds than he's built.
> 
> Now he intends to tear down and lower the height of Altepetls Great Mosquito Pigeon.
> `@MechanicalRift` was in the VC with me and Nukinmouse for that.
> 
> Point 3 - Muting, Time outs and soundboard "burger, burger, burger" administered in with cruel intentions
> Counsillor Nukinmouse doesnt just apply these punishments because i talk too much or that my mic is lame on my phone or i walked away with the tv on.  He does it with cruel intent to drown me out when he doesn't like what I have to say.  He does it to exclude me.  
> He does it because he knows im gonna tell him not to tear down the great mosquito pigeon.  
> He does it because im gonna tell them not to build a dick in gang shi
> He does it because im gonna tell them not to rip off Nara nor pick a war with them
> He does it because i don't approve of being willingly insided by Gang Shi.  No offense to tal's art.  that's kewl. 
> He does it because he knows i'm gonna tell the lil white boys that its not okay to say the n bomb
> He does it because i will discourage face reveals in this imperfect community

> I stumbled across nukins bunker near koby on the ice road
> 
> I had hoped to follow the to Nara but they ran off faster than me so I started making my way back and I'm not great on the ice roads but recognized koby so I figured I'd go over there but I stumbled onto a non labeled Nukin bunker and got trapped behind an unreinforced steel door with no escape button on the other side.

> At the same time, I'm times out from the discord.  I can't type.  I can't hear.  I can't speak.  Leave me the fuck alone.  Could have waited an hr for me to log.  Ya'll have known that tree was there, I knew that tree was going down but you chose to come over there while muted and timed out to my physical in game location to remove it then

**torynado**:

> Thank you for your patience your honor
> Im ready to proceed.

**awesome_daniel**:

> Thank you, counterclaimant, for presenting your evidence. We will now move on with the counter defendant's response, including any evidence and witness testimonies they may wish to present. `@nukinmouse` you may proceed.

**nukinmouse**:

> i will need some time to write out an arguement and gather the nessecary evidence etc
> `@awesome_daniel` Thank you for your patience,
> 
> In the above images is proof of the prior claim of people messaging her to get her to stop harassing me, none of these show any proof of me being the aggressor in fact it shows the opposite, that she in fact is the one causing issues and being the "problem".
> 
> As a counterpoint, the evidence of her being killed was an order from Arconis in council chambers that the judge is able to see was placed prior to me killing her. At the time i didnt have pearls when i killed her so X1025 then went to kill her. This order was given to put her on trial for this very issue that she has so kindly presented evidence against herself that she indeed did say these remarks and was warned against continuing to do so.
> 
> Given the immense lack of evidence to support her claim I ask that this counterclaim proceeding be dropped.

**awesome_daniel**:

> Thank you, counter defendant, for your response. In the interest of fairness and due process, a dismissal cannot occur unilaterally. Both parties must be in agreement for the proceedings to be dropped. Therefore, we will continue with the proceedings as scheduled unless both parties voluntarily decide to drop them.

> At this point in the proceedings, I would like to inquire if either party has any additional points, evidence, or statements they would like to present before we proceed to closing statements.

**nukinmouse**:

**torynado**:

> Sincerely, I don't want Nukinmouse or anyone else to die.  Tho if Nukin is standing on the edge of the trench one day, i might need to knock him into the water below.  I'll throw him some vines so he can get out.  i have 0 kills tho so like, even thats unlikely.

**awesome_daniel**:

> Before presenting the verdict, the court would like to clarify that the proceedings are based on the precedent set by the Appellate Decision of October 2019, which outlined definitions, hierarchies of harassment, and punishments.
> 
> Definitions:
> There are two defined types of harassment that are relevant to this case:
> - In-Game Harassment (IGH): Actions within the game that may cause emotional distress, directed with mal-intent, in retaliation, or that may exclude individuals based on personal matters. Examples include offensive language, repeated targeting, and defacing property.
> - On-Discord Harassment (ODH): Actions within Discord that cause emotional distress, are directed with mal-intent, in retaliation, or that may exclude individuals based on personal matters. Examples include inappropriate language, spam, harmful trolling, and threats.
> 
> Hierarchy of Acts:
> Harassment has been categorized into three levels of severity:
> 1. Incidental Harassment: The least severe act of harassment: any actions where the acting individual repeatedly creates acts that another player finds to be in a harassing manner, and the acting individual may not realize the acts to be in a harassing manner.
> 2. Minor Harassment: A moderate act of Harassment by an acting individual that causes distress to an individual, and the acting individual continues to repeat actions even after being repeatedly told to cease and desist harassing actions by the harassed individual or others.
> 3. Major Harassment: A severe act of Harassment by an acting individual done in a cruel and intentional manner done; with the intent of forcing someone to leave the community via means of repeated harassing acts, with the intent to cause someone great emotional distress, and/or with the intent of immense communal disruption.
> _ _
> The court has reviewed the charges brought against Torynado for Minor Harassment and has reached the following verdict:
> 
> Tornado has pleaded guilty to the Minor Harassment against Nukinmouse01. In accordance with the definition of Minor Harassment outlined under §3.2 of the Appellate Decision of October 2019, the court finds Tornado guilty of Minor Harassment as charged, both in-game (§2.A) and on Discord (§2.B).
> 
> The court hereby imposes the following punishment on Torynado for the offense of Minor Harassment:
> 
> 1. The court hereby issues Torynado a formal warning for their actions. This warning serves as a clear indication that their behavior, both in-game and on Discord, is unacceptable.
> 2. The court hereby requires Torynado to immediately cease any form of harassment, both in-game and on Discord, towards Nukinmouse01 or any other member of the community. 
> 3. The court hereby requires Torynado to issue a formal, written apology to Nukinmouse01 for their actions. This apology will be posted publicly on Yoahtl's Discord server.
> 4. As a consequence of their on-Discord harassment towards Nukinmouse01, the court hereby sentences Torynado to a temporary timeout on Discord lasting twenty-one (21) days. 
> 5. Considering the extension of harassment to in-game chat, the court hereby sentences Torynado to twenty-one (21) days of prison pearl time.
> 6. The court recognizes that Torynado did cease any harassment and will hereby grant Torynado the privilege of time served, effectively ending the sentence fifteen (15) days from now, on October 24, 2023.
> 
> The court emphasizes that engaging in such behavior, as demonstrated by Torynado’s actions, is considered bannable on CivMC, and extremely unacceptable within our community. Such conduct goes against the principles of respect, civility, and inclusivity that we uphold.
> _ _
> The court has reviewed the counterclaim filed by Torynado, formerly the defense, and has taken into consideration all the evidence and arguments presented therein. After examination of the evidence, arguments, and relevant precedents, the court renders its verdict on this counterclaim:
> 
> In reviewing the evidence presented in the counterclaim for Major Harassment, the court notes that the under §3.3 of the Appellate Decision of October 2019, Major Harassment is defined as "a severe act of Harassment by an acting individual done in a cruel and intentional manner.” However, the court finds that the counterclaim lacks substantial evidence to support the allegations of Major Harassment against Nukinmouse01. The evidence and arguments presented by the counter claimant, Torynado, do not establish that Nukinmouse01 engaged in such severe and intentional acts of harassment as defined.
> 
> Consequently, the court dismisses the counterclaim for Major Harassment filed by Torynado against Nukinmouse01, and Nukinmouse01 is acquitted of all Major Harassment charges.
> 
> Furthermore, to prevent conflict in the future, the court advises the counter defendant, Nukinmouse01, to cease any actions intended to exclude Torynado from voice chat or Discord interactions unless they engage in uncalled-for behavior, including harassment.
> 
> To conclude, the court encourages both parties to exercise restraint and seek amicable resolutions to conflicts in the future to prevent the recurrence of situations similar to this one. Such efforts will not only benefit the individuals involved but also contribute to the overall well-being of the community as a whole.
> 
> With this, the court is now dismissed. Thank you.

**nukinmouse**:

> as tory has apologized and been cordial to me can i request leniency 21 days time out and 21 days of prison pearl seems abit harsh

**awesome_daniel**:

> The court acknowledges Nukinmouse01's request for leniency in Torynado's punishment. Nukinmouse01 has requested that the timeout duration be eliminated and the prison pearl sentence be reduced by one week. After considering Nukinmouse01's statement, the court modifies the punishment as follows:
> 
> - Torynado shall no longer serve a timeout on Discord.
> - Torynado's prison pearl sentence will be reduced to fourteen (14) days, and they are granted the privilege of time served. This sentence will end in eight (8) days on October 17, 2023.
> 
> Furthermore, the court emphasizes that any future instances of harassment, either in-game or on Discord, will result in further consequences, including the potential for timeouts or more severe penalties.
> 
> The court now dismisses these proceedings, and this case is hereby closed.

**awesome_daniel**:

> Due to Torynado's continued disruptive behavior despite the previous leniency granted in her punishment, the court has decided to reinstate the original sentence, revoking the privilege of time served. Torynado will serve the full duration of her initial punishment as previously determined by the court, which includes:
> 
> 1. A temporary timeout on Discord lasting twenty-one (21) days.
> 2. Twenty-one (21) days of prison pearl time.
> 
> Furthermore, the court reiterates the requirement for Torynado to issue a formal, written apology to Nukinmouse01 for their actions. This apology will be posted publicly. Additionally, Torynado is instructed to cease any harassment or disruptive behavior effective immediately, as failure to do so may result in more severe penalties.

> `@cr1zzpy` if you still plan on appealing her sentencing, I’m going to give you 24 hours to start making your case.

**cr1zzpy**:

> Yes sorry my discord was glitching out for a second there
> I understand that the court is completely justified to give `@torynado` punishment for her actions, letting something like this slide lets fellow Yoahtlians think they can do the same, but a 21 day sentence is overkill, Torynado has been a part of Yoahtl for 7 years, Im not saying she should get special treatment but this is just a good way to sour relations instead of discourage her actions. civ is like an addiction where a few days not playing is withdrawal for Tory but 21 days is rehab, a week would be more than enough disruption to discourage an active addicted civver like Torynado from repeating the same action and discourage the behavior to other Yoahtlians. I also have evidence of Nukin being witnessed by a high justice member saying death threats multiple times in a vc but it not being brought to court, and when nukin started trolling Torynado in the vc I dont think she was in on the joke or would she react like this he'd built up a lot of tension with his and her conflict when she retaliated he decided to use this to then chew her out in court, does Yoahtl really want to promote this kind of toxic behavior? Where you can just gaslight people into doing something stupid and then use it to send them to hell for 3 weeks? Nukin said he apologized for what he did in the vc but it has no meaning if he just takes her to court the next day, which I have a screenshot of him admitting to it while apologizing about it, for these reasons I propose the sentence be shortened to 10 days including time served, more than enough of a sentence.

**solitaire1**:

> it's not "so loose" otherwise. The rule hasn't been applied to nukin because no one has sued nukin. It would only be "so loose otherwise" if there were multiple concurrent harassment cases and Tory's sentence was disproportional to the others who were found guilty

**cr1zzpy**:

> I have more to say I'll try do it all in one go though
> I had a lot to say but I now realize that it doesn't matter, but I still have 2 reasons why Torynado's sentence must be shortened. First of all this is Torynado's first and only crime in Yoahtl, she's had a clean slate until now, given she did say something questionable in global and still definitely deserves to be sentenced. However if we look back at a precedent case (Aki v. Shygdsamkd, Jun 2021), we can see that the verdict of this case was 3 weeks punishment. In this case one of those weeks was for the harassment and the other 2 weeks were for raiding, in this trial Tory was presented with 3 weeks for her first offense of harassment, if we are counting the second offense in global that should be like 2 weeks, there shouldn't be a case where a second offense harassment gets a worse for punishment than raiding and harassment, I understand that judges can do their sentencing time differently but the value of what was stolen was 64 diamonds which isn't small for the common civver, but it was met with a 2 week punishment (excluding the week that was added for harassment) which is still less than the sentence present and the same as the sentence given initially, now in this case the level of harassment was not stated but we can deduce it is likely not major based off the sentencing time, so the punishment of a minor harassment should be less than or equal to the sentence given for raiding and for these reasons the sentence should be lowered down to 2 weeks including time served

**Huskydog9988**:

> In Shy in Aki v. Shygdsamkd, 2021, while Shy was only pearled for 1 week due to the harassment charges, it’s the court’s opinion that the nature of the harassment perpetrated by Tory differs significantly from that of Shy. In Shy’s case, his harassment essentially culminated him sending taunting messages, and dumped junk into Aki’s mailbox. Tory’s case, however, differs in what I could consider a significant manner, she actively advocated for Nukin to commit self-harm. To make it explicitly clear, she deliberately, on multiple occasions, told Nukin to kill himself. In my eyes this is a significantly more serious offense than someone just being a nuisance as Shy was to Aki. As such, the time served for such an offense should be greater. Moving on, to address your point of the 64 diamonds of damage (in the Aki v. Shygdsamkd case) having less pearl time than Tory, I believe its justifiable. In my eyes, the crime of harassment is of greater significance than that of raiding. We shouldn’t value virtual items more than the potential psychological damage such abrasive messaging can cause to an actual human being. It is with this philosophy that I deny your appeal. `@cr1zzpy` `@torynado` `@galdeus`

**cr1zzpy**:

**Huskydog9988**:

> She was already granted leniency, and it was based on, as you’ve repeated stated, her being with yoahtl for 7 years.
