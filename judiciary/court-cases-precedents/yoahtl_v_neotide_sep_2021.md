# Yoahtl v. NeoTide, Sep 2021
## Case
With SpaceVolcano presiding, on 9th September 2021, GDAN on behalf of the Government of Yoahtl charged NeoTide with Dereliction of Duty. After pleading guilty, NeoTide was sentenced to 3 days Prison Pearled and 26 days Exile Pearled, and removed from Government groups during that time.

## Proceedings
**GDAN:**

>I would like to bring a case against Neotide for dereliction of duty as the general of Yoahtl, on behalf of the government of Yoahtl. Unbeknownst to the rest of the government until after it occured Neo planned to and indeed did obtain the pearl of minemaster under false pretenses and proceeded to free him. As such he has broken the trust of the rest of the government by not talking to us before engaging in foreign affairs, and has potentially acted against national interests. As such I ask that he serves an exile pearl sentence deemed sensible by yourself, and proportional to the capacity at which he committed dereliction of duty, as this is the first such time dereliction of duty will be going through the courts this will set the precedent for the length of such a sentence. I also ask on behalf of the council if he's not already been removed from the position of general that the courts remove him from the position, setting precedent that the appropriate response for dereliction of duty is to be removed from that role.

**SpaceVolcano:**

>The courts will hear the case of Yoahtl vs NeoTide oon the matter of dereliction of duty as General of Yoahtl.

**NeoTide:**

>In the interest of a lasting solution to the trouble I've brought to the nation, and also in the interest of brevity, I plead guilty on all charges.

**SpaceVolcano:**

>The courts accept the guilty plea of NeoTide to the Charge of Dereliction of Duty as general of Yoahtl .

>The title of General of Yoahtl is appointed by the Alcuahtl and the courts will not revoke that title as that duty falls to the Alcuahtl.

>On the matter of sentencing, as Dereliction of Duty is a major charge as it not only implies a breach of trust within the goverment, but to the people of the nation as well. It is one of the few crimes that can lead to major internal and external crisis and diplomatic incidents. Therfore the courts hereby sentence NeoTide to 3 days of Prison Pearl, followed by a downgrade to exile pearl of 26 days, for a total of 29 days served. The court also instructs the Government to revoke all group access beyond that of a normal citizen for the length of the sentence.
