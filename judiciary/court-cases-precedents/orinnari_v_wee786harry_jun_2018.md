>This is the second instance of just that occuring, but the third instance of him attacking me

>I have asked him to stop, and along with others telling him to stop, but he continues because of his proclivity to being an edgelord

>Are we really so desperate for new friends that we're willing to tolerate someone who says and does offensive and irritating things just because he can? I've spoken to multiple people and no of them particularly like him nor want him here, nor does he seem to want to be friendly, or at the very least respectful

**Dr_Oracle**:

>Wee786Harry, As the defendant you have the right to choose a presiding councilor to hear the case, Meat312 or Wingzero54

**Wee786Harry**:

**Wingzero54**:

>Alright Orinnari please proceed. Are you seeking damages from Harry?

**Wee786Harry**:

>im an escourt cant afford to give u much

**Aki**:

>Take this seriously harry

**Wee786Harry**:

>Okay i want a lawyer

**Orinnari**:

>He wont, he's switching between saying it was a joke, and that these three occurances were just an accident with his trackpad

>As for damages, the answer is no. My goal here is for Harry to get a formal warning basically saying that if he continues his behaviour, he'll be shunned.

**Wee786Harry**:

>I want a lawyer

**Wingzero54**:
