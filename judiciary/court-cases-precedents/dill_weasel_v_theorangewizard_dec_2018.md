## Case

## Proceedings
**Feathercrown**:

>I think dill's gonna sue orange

**Modshot**:

>My client would like to sue TheOrangeWizard for Murder an act which he completed through orders given to his people. As stated in the Yoahtl Crimes Act murder is killing another player, including indirectly via traps or other structures. And my client would also like to sue for general dickiness

**SpaceVolcano**:

>The court will allow this trial. Tigen you are nominated to preside over the complaint of Murder in the case of Dill_Weasel (Modshot esq. representing) vs. TheOrangeWizard. The general dickiness complaint is dismissed as frivolous.

**Tigen**:

>Alright. Modshot, is there any other things you would like to add as part of your opening statement?

>Also, what would you like to see as a resolution should you win the trial?

**Modshot**:

>As a resolution I would ask for 8 diamond blocks and a stack of iron blocks for reparations of my clients gear as well as wasting his time for business that he could have conducted to further his wealth. In the right hands wealth of that amount can be increased through the means of a market such as Yoahtl's.

**Tigen**:

>TheOrangeWizard, please give your opening statement.

**TheOrangeWizard**:

>As stated in the Yoahtl Crimes Act, murder is justified by explicit authorisation of the Alcuahtl or relevant Ololtic in cases of national security. Given that we are currently on alert, and that I am the Alcuahtl, I fail to see how my actions constitute murder.

>Furthermore, "dickishness" is not a crime, and even if the court decides to interpret this as referring to harassment, this is still not a valid claim, as the plaintiff is referring to a single - and justified - incident.

**Tigen**:

>Modshot, please present your first witness, piece of evidence, or personal testimony

**Modshot**:

>Well I'd like to say that I was ordered to kill Bringmethesoup on account of being a raider, too which I informed Oddish as well. We completed the task from the order that Orange gave me. Which again, was because he was a raider, not us being on any kind of alert.

>I'd say this screenshot proves that we are on anything but any kind of alert against traders.

>There is no such announcement that we are on any kind of alert in the public notices. So given that there is no case of national security then I believe his actions were not justified.

>My client held battle-ready gear only in the case of defending the valuables he had on his person.

>Given the evidence from this screenshot it is also shown that Orange ordered his murder in the case of him being a raider rather than this so called alert.

**Tigen**:

>TheOrangeWizard, Please provide any rebuttle you might have (if any), then provide your first witness, piece of evidence, or personal testimony

**TheOrangeWizard**:

>Anyone involved in international politics at the moment should be aware that tensions are high. In fact, we ordered an evacuation of NYC last night.

>This was not posted in a public channel because it concerns citizens of Yoahtl, not every member of our discord.

>The screenhot of bg's post was from several weeks ago, situations can change dramatically in that amount of time.

**Tigen**:

>Modshot, any rebuttle? If not, you may present a second witness, piece of evidence, or personal testimony.

>You may pass on either if you have nothing to add

**Modshot**:

>Yes, Is this chat able to be seen by all citizens or residents of Yoahtl? Like in the #member-notices Section. Or is it in another channel which only the government and a select few have access to?

**TheOrangeWizard**:

>It was posted in the citizenry channel, visible to all citizens.

**Modshot**:

>So you are alerting you're citizens but not your, residents... I see... sniffle I mean uh...

>I ask how does this not have anything to do with every member of the discord. Publicly, you show only that travel and possible entrance is allowed into Yoahtl. But privately you are allowed to kill whoever you please. In this case you, the government have effectively made a city into a deathtrap. Which would not be pleasing to friendly travelers and merchants such as my client. Would you do the same to your allies or effectively neutral citizens of other countries. I

**SpaceVolcano**:

>Modshot, The court will sustain an Objection to the Interrogatory of "In this case you, the government have effectively made a city into a deathtrap. Which would not be pleasing to friendly travelers and merchants such as my client. Would you do the same to your allies or effectively neutral citizens of other countries? " As certain matters are of State Security and may be kept at certain levels of privacies.

>you may continue TheOrangeWizard

**TheOrangeWizard**:

>The city is still open, merchants and travellers are welcome to use the rail station freely. Guests on Huechat are able to enter the city as they wish. Past raiders in the trench are a security risk.

>Furthermore I would like to indicate that similar actions taken near critical secure infrastructure of other nations would not meet such lenient penalties as having their items immediately repaired and returned.

**Modshot**:

>A security risk to which they are unaware of. Past raiders like GDAN. mmm...

**Tigen**:

>I find the defendant TheOrangeWizard not guilty. Given that there were substantiated claims on the assault victim in question for raiding (ones shared among our allies), and the fact that the individual in question was caught attempting to circumvent city defenses to get in (despite knowingly not having perms), an attempt to pearl was a valid security decision. Seeing too as no pearls were taken and all items were returned to @Yellows after their death, I find no reason that Orange should have to provide compensation in any capacity.

>With this, in conclusion, there will be no action taken against either party involved as a result of this trial. Further claims against Yoahtlans including but not limited to TheOrangeWizard (who ordered the assault) and Modshot (who perpetrated the assault) relating to this incident will be considered null as agreed upon by bringing this matter to court of law in the first place. As a probationary measure, Dill_Weasel will be asked to refrain from visiting NYC in the foreseeable future without permission from a government member of Yoahtl. Seeing as this case was taken with the express warning that there would be no appeals due to mistrial, I call this court case definitively adjourned.
