**SwordProof**:

> Thanks

> @SwordProof

> But do I get a lawyer

**ArkenX**:

> Lawyers aren't a requirement and aren't provides. As much as I'm sure they intended to mimic western justice systems, it's still a minecart server. If you have someone in mind and they're already available and ready to go, sure.

**SwordProof**:

> like the wild west?

**ArkenX**:

> In a sense, a more local application of the law.

**SwordProof**:

> Good morning, my name is SwordProof, and it is my pleasure to represent me on this very
> important case.I stand here falsely accused of theft, a very serious crime. I probably showed up on the snitches but i was breaking chests in xans apartment. He thinks its funny to take me off of our claims for no reason. At the
> conclusion of the case we will ask for a verdict of not guilty.

> my mincraft is broken

> i dont know hopw to fix it

**X_an**:

> I'ma joink ya statement

**SwordProof**:

> copied my statement kid

> guilty

**Quauhtli and Mia**:

> I am here sorry aha

> Hola compadres, I am Quauhtli; approximately 99% comprised of just six elements: Oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, calcium, and phosphorus. 0.85% being sulfur, potassium, sodium, chlorine, and magnesium.

**SwordProof**:

> ok buddy

> you took it to far with the elements

> i am deeply hurt

> craig

**Quauhtli and Mia**:

> I have come about to launch this trial in an effort to prove SwordProof has knowingly and maliciously committed theft. But also that X_an; while being complicit, has not done anything to aid or abet Sword in his crimes if not except those to defend his friend, and while I wish I could say someone should totally ditch their friend for minecraft; I cant, even if that friend seems like a Bonehead.

**SwordProof**:

> what if i am one

**Quauhtli and Mia**:

> It is my hypothesis that SwordProof had indeed stolen items with the intent of keeping said items to himself, but just as much that X_an truly did not want this to happen. Having been **Behooved** to act on the actions of a far more.. rowdy personality.

**SwordProof**:

> no proof

**Quauhtli and Mia**:

> It is my hope that this trial and investigation will ascertain the motives behind the events that transpired, and get at the root of the truth of what has happened.

> In which we as a community, and indeed even defendants may leave this trial with some closure.

**SwordProof**:

> ok im guilty

> 🟥 🖐️

**Quauhtli and Mia**:

> You're not getting off that easy buddy

**SwordProof**:

> ok im not guilty?

> like what else do you want me to say <:slightlyconcerned:900248083105992774>

**Quauhtli and Mia**:

> We go about this trial, see the events as what they've happened, why you did what you did, why xan did what he did, and why _We_ did what we did.

**SwordProof**:

> https://tenor.com/view/bhibatsam-girls-dance-sisters-dance-happy-dance-kids-dance-gif-26527005

**Quauhtli and Mia**:

> So we're all caught up, and we know whats what.

**SwordProof**:

> https://tenor.com/view/leslie-jordan-leslie-belly-dancing-belly-dance-dancing-gif-25526487

> ok so first

> im guilty

> then

> im guilty

> and lastly

> im guilty

> and xan isnt

> what do you want to know buddy

**Quauhtli and Mia**:

> I'm going to prove that, but not without showing every detail, with testimonies, juke/snitch proof, and actions.

> Thats what the trial is for, just wait for arken lol

**SwordProof**:

> ok whatever floats your boat but im guilty nothing to prove

**Quauhtli and Mia**:

> @ArkenX

**SwordProof**:

> 🤷‍♂️

**ArkenX**:

> @Quauhtli and Mia please present any evidence or call any witnesses to support your claims

**SwordProof**:

> yeah

> evidence b uddy

**ArkenX**:

> and please limit cross talk for the moment please, everyone will have ample time to respond

**SwordProof**:

> yes sir sorry sir

> can i say one more thing rtough?

> xan is a baddie 😉

**Quauhtli and Mia**:

> I'd like to call X*an: to present his bearing on what has happened... his \_HONEST* and _TRUTHFUL_ standing on what has transpired.

**X_an**:

> sure

> he stole

> that is my comment

> helped with what?

> anyway

**X_an**:

> on 03/24/2023 he stole from accoker in the morning

> i logged on and he was breaking out the walls of accoker's apartment

> i'ma just write a paragraph

> On 03/24/2023 he stole from accoker in the morning,
> I logged on and he was breaking out the walls of accoker's apartment with a netherite sword and a bow, I asked them where they got it and they said they found it in a barrel along some railway (Which i knew he was joking and just lying so that he wouldn't have to tell me the truth), so thats my report of his theft.

**SwordProof**:

> my turn now?

**X_an**:

> his chests were also filled with pots

**ArkenX**:

> Qua is calling evidence, witnesses.
>
> Then you and X_an will have a chance to refute and present your own

> @Quauhtli and Mia

**Quauhtli and Mia**:

> How did you know he was lying?

**X_an**:

> reasonable suspicion, because i saw him break out of accoker's apartment a second ago

> there are snitch loggers are't there, can't we get someone to check that

> thats how SwordProof got caught in the first place

**Quauhtli and Mia**:

> You two are friends, so you two are usually together most of the time, yes?

**SwordProof**:

> no not really

> only when i stole

**ArkenX**:

> Alright so.
>
> We're gonna try to do this in an organized fashion somewhat.
>
> We're all gonna have a chance to talk.

> Qua asked X_an, so let's jump back to that

> then we can go from there

**X_an**:

> When he is online in the server we are usually together but he goes away once in a while

**Quauhtli and Mia**:

> But you can corroborate that you were basically there when the theft itself took place?

**X_an**:

> Not in the building

> Not online when it started

> but logged on, and went to the apartment building

> when i saw him breaking out and replacing the wall

> so no i wasn't there

**Quauhtli and Mia**:

> I see, has he ever told you where he got those items from?

**X_an**:

> He didn't tell me truthfully

> I had to find out when ACcoker announced that he has been robbed

**Quauhtli and Mia**:

> Did Sword show you the items he supposedly found"

**X_an**:

> He showed it to me in his hands

> is there a jury?

**ArkenX**:

> There's me

**SwordProof**:

> and me because i cant talk

**ArkenX**:

> @Quauhtli and Mia do you have any more questions

**Quauhtli and Mia**:

> I do infact.

> What did sword tell you he was doing? like what exactly did he say?

**X_an**:

> At which time? When he showed me the items?

**Quauhtli and Mia**:

> Yes, Just before, and shortly after

**X_an**:

> This was 3 days ago so my memory on his words aren't so clear.
>
> I remember that he said, "You can't bully me anymore" when he showed me his items(Which happened on the street of my plot, west of my plot)
>
> But I don't recall what he said before
>
> After he showed his items i believe we went to the mines and i showed him my progress

**Quauhtli and Mia**:

> And the thing he showed you was a netherite sword, yes?

**X_an**:

> Yes and a bow

**Quauhtli and Mia**:

> Right well, I believe someone was willing to infact _give_ me the proof of the actual _breaking_, and mind you our city is **VERY** tight; almost no theft ever happens, if at all. No break ins like this.

**SwordProof**:

**NeoTide**:

> I would like to clarify that only sword proof was on snitches breaking chests, which includes engineering bean's chests, because those were within the jukebox's range. Xan appeared in the area but didn't break anything. The court can draw whatever conclusions they want from that, but those are the facts
