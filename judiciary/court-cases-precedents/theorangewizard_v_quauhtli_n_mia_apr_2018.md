## Case
With BustaNuht presiding, TheOrangeWizard charged Quauhtli'n'Mia with Facilitating Unauthorised Access. Quauhtli'n'Mia was found guilty but not sentenced.

## Proceedings
**TheOrangeWizard**:

>Quauhtli'n'Mia, I am charging you with unlawfully granting access to the city to LordEmberscar and Modestx, in violation of the executive decision that access for individuals not on Huechat must be approved by a government member

**Quauhtli'n'Mia**:

>I can account for ember, but I dont know modest O-o

**TheOrangeWizard**:

>He was allowed in at the same time as Emberscar

**Quauhtli'n'Mia**:

>Also, when I let ember I let it fairly known in huechat

>what?

>No he wasnt lol

>when ember arrived only he was here

**GDAN**:

>ModestX is a newfriend i was talking to them earlier today when they started hitting snitches

**TheOrangeWizard**:

>I know he's a newfriend, that's why LordEmberscar came here in the first place, to show Modestx in

**Quauhtli'n'Mia**:

>thats not what he told me, or what I remember

>me and him were pming eachother about how lex died and how he insided them; and then I asked him if he could join us and he started on his way

>When he got here it was only him.

>You were outside with someone when he was here too

>you were clearing grass or something outside the walls

>he was in your face

**TheOrangeWizard**:

>Please choose a judge for the trial

**Quauhtli'n'Mia**:

>BustaNuht ?

>would you be my judge?

**BustaNuht**:

>it would be an honor

>the plaintiff starts with their opening statement

**TheOrangeWizard**:

>Quau invited and let LordEmberscar into NYC without government approval, violating the directive that approval must be given to anyone not on huechat. I'll drop the charge regarding Modestx seeing as I'm not sure on the details.

>I believe this is a serious offence that undermines the security of the city and should be punished with fines and/or end time.

**Quauhtli'n'Mia**:

>Well I did what I did obviously; and i dont quiite rmember this law but im going to assume its a law because you said so and because i have terrible memory

>HOWEEVAARR
>Not only were you among other councillors present during the coming of ember

>I also announced his coming in the discord here
>In which; bg said he was fine; and I think you did too

>now it'd be pretty understandeable sueing me like, yesterday for it

>but now i b scratchin my noggy cuz its like a full day l8r

**TheOrangeWizard**:

>I attempted to do so but you weren't here and other people had other trials

**Quauhtli'n'Mia**:

>but the other several points stand

>It was either general or citizenry

>lemme check

>Oh SPIDER did it for me

>he pinged government

>and you came on

>Oh woops bg said yes but your "no' still stood

>is it still a No?

>Cus ember DID help inside laconia/Lex

>Regardless you were present during the whole time ember came in

>we were even in Local chat

>At any givin moment you couldve hollar'd out and told me to stop and him to leave

>ofcourse that didnt quite happen.

>Now I can agree; a law's a law.

>I kind of remember when you guys announced now

>back when what's his name came into town and tried to assasiante bg i think?

**BustaNuht**:

>yes

**Quauhtli'n'Mia**:

>ye yee I remember

>Welp thats my only defense 😛

**BustaNuht**:

>okay

>TheOrangeWizard do you have anything to say in response?

**TheOrangeWizard**:

>Modestx is a newfriend that Emberscar brought along, I'm ignoring him for the purposes of this case

>Quau's decision to invite Emberscar without permission, and then neglecting to tell anyone, in my opinion constitutes a violation of the law.

**Quauhtli'n'Mia**:

>I low-key told everyone my dood

>🤷🏽

**TheOrangeWizard**:

>where

**Quauhtli'n'Mia**:

>In huechat and in general

>Again; you were in huechat AND active the moment he came and the moment I told people I wanted to bring ember over

>you were cutting a bunch of grass outside of the walls and ember walked by you

**TheOrangeWizard**:

>I was completely unaware of this until he showed up at the gate

**Quauhtli'n'Mia**:

>Not my fault you dont pay attention my dude

>The ping for the whole gove made by string in general happened BEFORE that too

>so you HAD to have known it happening

>or atleast; in the back of your head?

>Why didnt you just outright tell him to leave or atleast tell me to tell him to leave

>when all of this was going on?

**Quauhtli'n'Mia**:

>Cuz wing was around and active during this too

**TheOrangeWizard**:

>I explicitly said no

**Quauhtli'n'Mia**:

>Bg said he was fine; but he said it was your final word

>and I wasnt sure what your final word was; so I assumed you'd tell me or him to leave :/

>which didnt happen

**TheOrangeWizard**:

>BustaNuht, This is going around in circles, please make a judgement

>In my view Quau has been extremely negligent towards the law

**BustaNuht**:

>so according to these chat logs you offered ember an apartment almost immediately after greeting him/her into the city, and you asked us retroactively if it was okay. Because you did ask the government for approval, I will not place sanctions on you. However this case shall set precedent that any newcomers must receive government approval PRIOR to receiving residence and any citizens who give newcomers an apartment without prior govt approval will be sanctioned.

**TheOrangeWizard**:

>For the purpose of setting precedent, what action will the court take should this occur again?

**BustaNuht**:

>90 minutes of manual labor

**SpiderString**:

>I only just saw this now, but for prosperity: My ping to the government was after Quauh had logged off and shown emberscar around, not before. Ember had asked for the coords to bring some newfriend to Yoahtl. I didn't give them, but he somehow got here anyway. Sometime between him asking and showing up was when I pinged gov't.

>Also what may or may not be worth noting, ember managed to get on huechat and claims Orange added him. idk if that's true or not.

>April 10th, CST Quauh is online and invites ember, later on in the log ember leaves saying he "may return but probably not"

>April 11th, CST, Quauh is offline and ember asks me for coords, where I refuse.

>Same day, ember and modest show up at gate

**Quauhtli'n'Mia**:

>ember said orange added him?

>See if I knew these things I wouldve just payed the fine :/

**SpiderString**:

>https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/348687557455904778/433868179794690058/unknown.png

>Yes, he claimed orange "let him in", which I took to mean orange added him to hue as I saw him opening the southern gate on his own

>I may have misinterpreted that.

**TheOrangeWizard**:

>Yes, I let him in after consulting with the council and defense team

>This was after Spider's ping
