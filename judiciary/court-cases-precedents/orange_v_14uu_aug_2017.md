# TheOrangeWizard v. 14uu, Aug 2017

## Case

With ArowShot presiding, on 20th August 2017, TheOrangeWizard charged 14uu with Interfering with Public Infrastructure, Griefing, and Disorderly Conduct. ArowShot [without addressing any of the charges] sentenced 14uu an hour of undercity digging, and ordering that the basement be removed and the roof/floor be repaired stipulating that once the district is complete, the basement can be re-attempted so long as it abides by build codes.

## Proceedings

**TheOrangeWizard**:

> Okay, I'm bringing 3 charges against 14uu  
> First is interfering with public infrastructure by constructing a basement in the under-construction undercity  
> Second is griefing by placing cobblestone on and mining under Feathercrown's house and iron reinforced chests on my roof  
> Third is disorderly conduct by being generally uncooperative and insulting several citizens

**14uu**:

> first : i need more space and there wasnt any other alternative to getting more space  
> second : i request the first part of that charge to be removed except if Feathercrown want to make that claim

**Feathercrown**:

> I agree with 14, the first part of that charge was in retaliation to me; I griefed him inretaliation to the digging.  
> So the grief was fair, the digging is a valid claim

**14uu**:

> and the second is which you requested me to destroy my basement extension so i angered about it built my new storage, which i needed space for on the roof of my opressor instead, as a act of violent protest even thou our law forbid it

**TheOrangeWizard**:

> I'll change the second charge to be for mining under Feathercrown's house and placing the chests.

**14uu**:

> 3rd: i did not insult any other citizens except you, and i insulted for opressing my basement extension, and did not cause any heavy disorder, without "agreement" from the other side (grief batle) and i dug under feather's house to get more space too but after he forbiding it my only alternative was to xpand my basement into the undercity layer 2, which is aleredy destinated to be a residence zone

**ArowShot**:

> Is the basement still there?

**TheOrangeWizard**:

> Yes

**Feathercrown**:

> Confirmed

**ArowShot**:

> Can someone show me the basement?

**ArowShot**:

> 14 does your basement really need to be 4 floors deep?

_(14uu goes offline)_

**ArowShot**:

> Should we continue tomorrow or should I give my verdict

**TheOrangeWizard**:

> Up to you  
> Also, by my count his basement is 8 floors deep

**ArowShot**:

> And there's clearly room for horizontal expansion

**Feathercrown**:

> Oh wait yeah, he can build under the street right?

**ArowShot**:

> On the floor above the roof there is a cave to expand into

**TheOrangeWizard**:

> You can build whereever as long as it's not in the way of anyone else's stuff

**Feathercrown**:

> That's Aki's district though  
> Tbh what's the basement's problem

**TheOrangeWizard**:

> The cavern is still being excavated and it doesn't match the intended aesthetic

**ArowShot**:

> I think I'll have him remove his basement until that area is complete then give him a change to build it there  
> I'll do my final verdict when he is online though

_(later on)_

**ArowShot**:

> For your crimes against the government remove your basement and repair the roof/floor, when that district is complete you will be given an opportunity to extend your basement into that area, provided it follows building code and for crimes against other citizens I'll put you to manual labor digging out the undercity
